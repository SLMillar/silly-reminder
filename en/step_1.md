## Introduction

This is a **Discover** project, this project will help you explore what the **micro:bit** can do and decide whether you want to learn more. 

### What you will make

Here's a project to remind you to loosen up and stike a pose! This could be after a long day at school, or a way to cheer you and your friends up. You can program the micro:bit buttons to help you remember to have some silly fun.

In this project you are going to make a **silly reminder**. 

You will: 
+ Use variables to store data
+ Draw icons to the LEDs
+ Use `if... then` blocks to select a melody to play
+ Use buttons

### Opening MakeCode

To get started creating your micro:bit project, you will need to open the MakeCode editor.

--- task ---

Open the MakeCode editor at [makecode.microbit.org](https://makecode.microbit.org)

--- collapse ---

---
title: Offline version of the editor
---

There is also a [downloadable version of the MakeCode editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/offline-app).

--- /collapse ---

--- /task ---

Once the editor is open, you will need to create a New Project and give your project a name. 

--- task ---

Click on the **New Project** button.

![The new project button inside of MakeCode.](images/new-project-button.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Create your project with the name `silly-reminder` and click **Create**.

![The name 'silly-reminder' written in the New Project dialogue box.](images/new-project.png)

**Tip:** Give your project a helpful name that relates to the activity youâ€™re creating. This will make it easier to find if you create other projects on MakeCode.

### The MakeCode Editor

Created by the micro:bit Foundation, the **MakeCode editor** has everything you need to get started coding on micro:bit. 

![](images/makecode-tour.png)

On the left side there is a **simulator**, this contains a virtual micro:bit that you can use to test your code! 

It has all the features and buttons found on a V2 micro:bit, including:
+ LED Display
+ Speaker
+ Microphone
+ Input buttons
    + A
    + B
    + Logo

In the centre there is the **blocks panel** which is colour coded and allows you to access various code blocks.

On the right side there is a main **code editor panel** to drag and drop blocks into when creating your program.

### Display Icon

The MakeCode editor panel already contains two blocks: `on start` and `forever`.

You will make use of the `on start` block to see how the LEDs on the simulator work.

--- task ---

Click on the Basic blocks in the Blocks panel. This will expand to show you various groups of blocks that you can use in your project.

![](images/basic-blocks.png)

Drag the `show icon` block and place it **inside** the `on start` block. 

Once placed in, the block will fit in place like a puzzle.

![](images/onstart-showicon.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Click the down arrow on the show icon block and choose any icon of your choice.

![](images/show-icon.png)

In this example we have chosen the `heart` icon.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test:** Click the play button on the emulator, the LED display should light up, showing your chosen icon.

![](images/led-display.png)

Well done for getting the leds on the micro:bit to light up!

--- /task ---

### Choose some poses

You will need to decide what silly faces/poses you will make whenever you push a micro:bit button. Here are some ideas for poses you could use:

+ Happy face icon for when you're feeling happy
+ An icon pose for when you're feeling excited
+ An icon pose to energise you when you're feeling tired
+ An icon pose for when you're feeling restless


### Create a timer for each pose

Create a variable that will be used as a timer for how long you should hold each pose.

--- task ---
Open the `Variables` block menu, and click **Make a variable**.

![The Variables block menu, open with the "Make a variable" button highlighted](images/variable-menu.png)
--- /task ---

--- task ---

Name the new variable `timer`. 

![The "New Variable" name window, with the name timer written in the box](images/variable-examplename.png)

--- /task ---

New blocks will be created that you can use in your program and change the value stored in the `timer` variable. 

![The Variable block menu - with new block to set the value of timer, to change the value of timer and to use the value of timer in your code.](images/variable-blocks.png)

--- task ---

Drag the `set [timer] to 0` block inside the `onstart` block and change the 0 to 10.

![TODO - Change this image for embedded blocks](images/set-timer-variable.png)

--- /task ---

### Set icon for each pose

You will now program the A and B input buttons on the micro:bit to help you select an icon for each pose.

--- task ---

Click on the `input` menu and drag the `on button A pressed` block.

![TODO - replace with embedded blocks](images/buttonA-pressed.png)

 Place it onto the **code editor panel** 

--- /task ---

--- task ---
Inside the `Basic` menu, drag the `show leds` block below the `on button A pressed` block.

![TODO - replace with embedded blocks](images/show-leds.png)

You can click on each of the squares to draw your picture. In this example, we have drawn a smiley face as a silly pose.

![TODO - replace with embedded blocks](images/drawicon-led.png)

--- /task ---

You will want the icon to be displayed for some time before changing so you will need to make use of a `pause ms` block. This is measured in milliseconds.

--- task ---

Also drag a `pause (ms) 100` block from the `Basic` menu and drag it below the `show leds` block inside the `on button A pressed` block.

![TODO - replace with embedded blocks](images/pause-ms.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Change the 100 in the `pause (ms) 100` block to a longer time so the icon can be displayed for longer. We have set it to 2000 ms in this example.

![TODO - replace with embedded blocks](images/pause-2000.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Right click on the `set timer` block inside the `on start` block. Click `Duplicate` to make a copy of it.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Place the duplicated `set timer` below the `pause (ms) 2000` block inside the `on button A pressed` block.

![TODO - replace with embedded blocks](images/settimer-pressed.png)

--- /task ---

To create more than one pose that can be selected, you will need to use another input button on the micro:bit. This will be the `on button B pressed` block.

--- task ---

Right click on the entire `on button A pressed` block. Click `Duplicate` to make a copy of it.

![TODO - replace with embedded blocks](images/duplicate-block.png)

You will now have an exact copy of all the blocks of code inside `on button A pressed` on the code editor panel.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Click the down arrow next to the A on your duplicated `on button A pressed` block. Change the `A` to `B`.

![TODO - replace with embedded blocks](images/button-options.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Change the squares on the `show leds` block inside the `on button B pressed` block to create a new pose icon.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Run** the program and you should see the `heart` icon (or your chosen icon) appear. 

**Test** Press the `A` button to test the icon that displays on the led. Take a note of how long it shows for

Do the same to test the `B` button.

**Change** You can change the value in your `pause ms` block to increase or decrease the time the icons are shown for on each button press.

--- /task ---

### Create a countdown

You will now create a countdown using the `timer` variable which you had previously set to 10 seconds and ensure that the timer decreases by 1 second, each time.

--- task ---
From the `Basic` menu, drag the `show number` block and place it inside the `forever` block on the editor panel.

![TODO - replace with embedded blocks](images/show-number.png)

Click on the `Variables` menu, drag out the `timer` variable block and place it inside the `0` on the `show number` block

![TODO - replace with embedded blocks](images/shownumber-timer.png)

--- /task ---

To create the logic to check if the timer is greater than 0, then make it count down, you will need an `if..then..else` logic condition block. 

--- task ---
Click on the `Logic` menu. Drag the `if..then..else` logic block and place it below the `show number` block.

![TODO - replace with embedded blocks](images/ifelse-condition.png)

--- /task ---

--- task ---

From the `Logic` menu, also drag out a comparison block `0=0`.

![TODO - replace with embedded blocks](images/comparison-block.png)

Place it inside the `true` space within the `if..then..else` block.

--- /task ---

--- task ---
From the `Variables` menu, drag out the `timer` variable block and place it inside the first `0` on the `0=0` comparison block.

Change the `=` to a `>` than symbol using the drop down arrow on the comparison block.

--- /task ---

You will want to reduce the timer by -1 if the timer is greater than 0.

--- task ---

Using the `Variables` menu, drag the `change timer by 1` block and place it within the `if.. then` section of blocks. Also change the `1` to `-1`.

--- collapse ---

---

---

Inside the `Music` menu, drag the `play..tone..Middle C for 1 beat.. until done` block. Place it below the `change timer by -1` variable block.

Click on the `Middle C` module and a piano keys console will appear. Choose a suitable note for your timer. In this example we have selected `Middle` A.

--- /collapse ---

--- /task ---

After each second is displayed on the micro:bit, you can also add a pause to make the timer more realistic.

--- task ---

Right click on any of the `pause ms` blocks already on the editor panel to duplicate it. Drag and drop this below the `play tone..for 1 beat` block.

Change `2000` ms to `1000`ms. You can also try out various durations to suit your preference.
--- /task ---

You can now add a message to let you know when to change your silly pose. You can do this by making use of the `else` condition block.

--- task ---

Inside the `Basic` menu, drag out the `show string` block. Place it below the `else` condition block inside the `if..then..else` condition block.

Change the string `Hello!` to `Pose`.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Run** the program to check that all your code is working. 

**Press** the A button to see the pose icon displayed. 

**Press** the B button to see another pose icon displayed.  

**Check** the countdown timer is working and counting from 10 backwards. 

**Check** that a tone is played after each second counts down.  

--- /task ---

--- save --- 

### Uploading your program to the micro:bit

**Save** and download your code so you can test it out on a physical micro:bit.

--- task ---

Click on the `Download` button below the micro:bit simulator. 

![Highlighted download button on the MakeCode editor](images/download-button.png)

You will be asked to plug in your micro:bit, do that now, then click **Continue**. 

Now to Pair your micro:bit, click **Pair** and select your device from the list that appears, then click **Connect**.

![Select micro:bit dailog box showing a BBC micro:bit device.](images/select-microbit.png)

--- collapse ---

title: My microbit won't pair
---

If your micro:bit won't pair using the method above, it will download the program for you. 

**Windows:** Open **File Explorer** and check that you can see `MICROBIT` under `This PC` on the left hand side. If it is there, drag the downloaded `.HEX` file into the micro:bit, your program will upload onto the device and you should be able to use it. 

**MacOS:** Open **Finder** and check that you can see `MICROBIT` under `Locations` on the left hand side. If it is there, drag the downloaded `.HEX` file into the micro:bit, your program will upload onto the device and you should be able to use it.

If the device isn't showing up, try unplugging it and plugging it back in. You can also try a different USB slot or USB cable if they are available.

--- /collapse ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

**Test** Run your program on the physical micro:bit. You should now see icons randomly chosen when you shake the device.

--- /task ---

### Upgrade your project

You can upgrade your project to make it more engaging by doing the following:

+ Add more silly poses so you can have a wider range to choose from.
+ Randomise the pose that gets selected afer the timer counts down
+ Add other input gestures such as shake and on logo press.
